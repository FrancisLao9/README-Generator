# Professional README Generator Starter Code
## Description

    Almost every professional program has a README.md file to compliment it. This is usually for anyone who plans on using or working on the program and what information they would need. This program makes the process more simple by eliminating the more tedious aspects of it such as fonts and a table of contents by providing it. All the user has to do is provide the quality information necessary for a high quality README.md file to match their work.
